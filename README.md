# 🚌 Metropolis Bus Stop Display  

This project was developed as part of my university coursework. The goal was to build a **real-time bus stop display system** for the city of Metropolis, handling live updates on bus arrivals, delays and cancellations.  

## 🔹 What It Does  
✅ Displays the next **10 upcoming buses** at a stop, including their status (on time, delayed or canceled).  
✅ **Fetches and processes** bus stop data from configuration files.  
✅ Uses the **Observer Pattern** to receive **real-time notifications** about delays and cancellations.  
✅ **Simulates a central bus tracking system**, keeping the display updated every **15 seconds**.  

## 🏆 Why It Matters  
This project was designed to mimic a **real-world transportation system**, testing my ability to **design scalable software**, work with **real-time data** and apply **efficient software engineering principles**.
